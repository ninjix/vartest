IS 210: Software Application Programming (Week 1)
*************************************************

This week, we'll be covering variables in all their various forms. You will be 
expected to produce a number of variables of different types and apply some of 
the methods we've used earlier to them.

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Core Content
============
    
Create an integer variable
--------------------------

#. Create a new file called `integer.py`

#. Create a variable named `cars` and assign it the value of `100`

#. Return the `cars` variable

Create a string variable
------------------------

#. Create a new file called `string.py`

#. Create a variable named `driver` and assign it the value of `Susan`

#. Return the `driver` variable

Simple math with variables
--------------------------

#. Create a new file called `divide.py`

#. Create a variable called `eggs` and assign it the value of `12`

#. Divide the `eggs` variable by `2` and return the result

String operations on a variable
-------------------------------

#. The file `string_ops.py` contains several string variables already. Begin by
   adding a new line to concatenate the strings and save the resultant string 
   into a new variable.

#. Add another line to slice the new string variable in half.

#. Return the first half.

String formatting with variable substitution
--------------------------------------------

#. Using the file `format.py`, create a new variable and assign it a value of 
   `24`.

#. Return the `mystring` variable, performing a format operation that will pass 
   in the variable created in step #1.

Advanced Application
====================

Multiple Format Substitutions I
-------------------------------

#. Replace all format strings in `multi.py` with keyword arguments.

#. Return the result


Multiple Format Substitutions II
--------------------------------

#. Create a new format string that can utilize the format variables in 
   `multi2.py`

#. Return the result

Code Analysis I
---------------

#. Alter `analyze.py` by minimally changing the file so that the code 
   returns the following string:

    .. code:: python

        'It was a beautiful day to run ten miles in the park!'
